Next steps to take:

1. Modify Custom Bollinger Bands strategy script to include dynamic position sizing and create alerts from strategy script
2. Research ways to identify trend/anti-trend markets (regime shift) to enhance Renko strategy returns in strong trends
3. Research ways to identify range bound market and implement a range bound strategy. Overall script should switch between range bound and trending strategy based on market condition
4. Use price action and TA techniques to identify a fakeout trend reversal which would continue. This can reduce unnecessary trades.
5. Research optimal indicators or combination of indicators which provide strong trend indication - for leveraging trades
6. Do parameter optimization/walk forward analysis of strategy on each futures contract
7. Do portfolio level optimization and backtest in Python. Build full fledged bactesting and execution platform for crypto/stocks
8. Look for risk minimization against USDT - research Renko strategy on pairs not associated with USDT
9. Look into optimal execution techniques for Renko strategy on stocks to reduce slippage
10. Run month-by-month analysis of portfolio performance - backtest and live trading analysis
11. Recode strategy script so it can run on regular 1m candlesticks but calculations should be done in the background on renko bars
12. Move entire trading operation to cloud server
13. Create automated post trade analysis script to check for slippages
14. Backtesting Platform in R/Python- integrating the strategy as a function input
15. Explore possibility of Tradingview API to schedule timed jobs for PTA automation/data export
16. Look into using Tradingview webhooks to create independent order placement system for multiple crypto exchanges and stock brokerages
17. Come up with methods to deal with/hedge flash crash risk - sharpe move within 1 min could cause large losses/liquidation
18. EXPAND TO AT LEAST 10 COINS on Binance for further diversification and ability to deploy more capital: Choose from LTC, BCH, ETC, BNB, IOTA
19. Re-run backtests every 6 months to account for change in prices - bar sizes would need to be adjusted accordingly
