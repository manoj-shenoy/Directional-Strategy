Next steps to take:

1. Modify Custom Bollinger Bands strategy script to include dynamic position sizing and create alerts from strategy script
2. Research ways to identify trend/anti-trend markets to enhance Renko strategy returns in strong trends
3. Research ways to identify range bound market and implement a range bound strategy. Overall script should switch between range bound and trending strategy based on market condition
4. Research optimal indicators or combination of indicators which provide strong trend indication - for leveraging trades
5. Do parameter optimization/walk forward analysis of strategy on each futures contract
6. Do portfolio level optimization and backtest in Python. Build full fledged bactesting and execution platform for crypto/stocks
7. For future security/risk minimization - research Renko strategy on pairs not associated with USDT
